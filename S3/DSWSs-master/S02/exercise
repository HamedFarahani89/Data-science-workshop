1. Write a function which returns factorial function of a number while its input is the number.

input:
    x (int)
output:
    x! (int)    

2. Write a function which checks if a number is prime. The function takes a number from user, true means 
prime while false means otherwise.

    True if it is prime, False otherwise (bool)

3. Write a function which returns all words started with a specific letter (for example a) and ended with 
another specific letter from a given text file. The input will be the file name. The function should take 
the file name and make a list of the words.

input:
    file name (string)
    first letter (string)
    second letter (string)
output:
    list of the words (list)

4. Write a function which finds and replaces "word 1" with "word 2" in a text file. The input will be the
 file name and the output should be the new (word replaced) string.

input:
    file name (string)
    first word (string)
    second word (string)
output:
    the word replaced text (string)

**THE INPUT(s) NEEDS TO BE PASSED BY sys.argv FUNCTION IN ALL QUESTIONS.**
