1. You were provided with a dataset containing data of different variables for all countries ((see here)[https://github.com/vafaei-ar/DSWSs/blob/master/S04/notebooks/SS02-02.ipynb]). The problem is several data points in this dataset are missing. You must fill all the NaN data points without deleting any of them and produce a full dataset without any NaNâ€™s. 

Use appropriate method for any variable. For example, For continuum variables, you can use regression method. If the variable contains different classes, use a classifier. Train on 70% of data and test on the rest of data.
